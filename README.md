# R2R-UI-Project

A minimal UI project starting point. This repository currently includes basic project hygiene files and can be expanded into your preferred frontend stack.

## Quick start

1. Decide your stack (e.g., React + Vite, Next.js, or plain HTML/CSS/JS).
2. Initialize the project scaffolding (I can do this for you on request).
3. Commit and push changes.

## Project structure

```
.
├─ README.md           # Project overview
├─ .gitignore          # Common ignores
└─ .editorconfig       # Editor consistency
```

## Contributing

- Use LF line endings and UTF-8 encoding (enforced via `.editorconfig`).
- Open an issue or PR for significant changes.

## License

License to be decided. Add a LICENSE file (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.) when ready.
